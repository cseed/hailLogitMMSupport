	abstract = {We propose a new data-augmentation strategy for fully Bayesian inference in models with binomial likelihoods. The approach appeals to a new class of Polya-Gamma distributions, which are constructed in detail. A variety of examples are presented to show the versatility of the method, including logistic regression, negative binomial regression, nonlinear mixed-effects models, and spatial models for count data. In each case, our data-augmentation strategy leads to simple, effective methods for posterior inference that: (1) circumvent the need for analytic approximations, numerical integration, or Metropolis-Hastings; and (2) outperform other known data-augmentation strategies, both in ease of use and in computational efficiency. All methods, including an efficient sampler for the Polya-Gamma distribution, are implemented in the R package BayesLogit. In the technical supplement appended to the end of the paper, we provide further details regarding the generation of Polya-Gamma random variables; the empirical benchmarks reported in the main manuscript; and the extension of the basic data-augmentation framework to contingency tables and multinomial outcomes.},

	abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with \$J {\textgreater} 2\$ categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed models (LMMs) are widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to account for population structure and relatedness, for both continuous and binary traits. Motivated by the failure of LMMs to control type I errors in a GWAS of asthma, a binary trait, we show that LMMs are generally inappropriate for analyzing binary traits when population stratification leads to violation of the LMM’s constant-residual variance assumption. To overcome this problem, we develop a computationally efficient logistic mixed model approach for genome-wide analysis of binary traits, the generalized linear mixed model association test (GMMAT). This approach fits a logistic mixed model once per GWAS and performs score tests under the null hypothesis of no association between a binary trait and individual genetic variants. We show in simulation studies and real data analysis that GMMAT effectively controls for population structure and relatedness when analyzing binary traits in a wide variety of study designs.},
